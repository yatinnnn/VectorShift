# VectorShift Frontend Technical Assessment


## Assignment Overview

This repository contains the solution to the **VectorShift Frontend Technical Assessment**. The project consists of a frontend built using **React** and a backend implemented with **FastAPI**. The goal of this project is to create a flexible and reusable node abstraction, enhance the styling, improve the text node logic, and integrate the frontend with the backend for pipeline submission.

## Project Structure


### How to Run

1. **Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the `/frontend` folder.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm start
     ```
   - The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Backend**:
   - Navigate to the `/backend` folder.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload
     ```
   - The backend will start on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Part 1: Node Abstraction

A reusable and flexible node abstraction was created to simplify building new nodes. This abstraction allows you to easily add new nodes by defining the following:

- **Input Handles** and **Output Handles**
- Customizable fields (e.g., text inputs, dropdowns)
- Shared UI components across different node types

### New Nodes Created:
- Checkbox Node
- Color Picker Node
- Input Node
- String Concatenate Node
- Multiplier Node

## Part 2: Styling

Styling was applied using **TailwindCSS** and **NextUI** to create a modern and clean interface. The design prioritizes usability, with proper visual cues for node connections and interactive components.

### Features:
- Drag-and-drop pipeline builder
- Interactive components with smooth transitions and hover effects

## Part 3: Text Node Logic

The **Text Node** was improved with the following functionality:

1. **Dynamic Resizing**: The node adjusts its width and height based on the text input to improve visibility.
2. **Variable Detection**: Users can define variables inside double curly braces (`{{ variable }}`). The node automatically generates input handles for these variables, allowing them to interact with other nodes.

## Part 4: Backend Integration

The frontend is integrated with the **FastAPI** backend. When a pipeline is submitted, the frontend sends the nodes and edges to the backend. The backend performs the following:

- Calculates the number of nodes and edges.
- Checks if the pipeline forms a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** using **NetworkX**.
- Returns a result to the frontend, which displays it via a toast notification.

### Backend Endpoint:
```http
POST /pipelines/parse
```

#### Request:
```
{
    "nodes": [...],
    "edges": [...]
}
```
#### Response:

```
{
    "num_nodes": 5,
    "num_edges": 4,
    "is_dag": true
}
```

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- React
- React Flow
- NextUI
- TailwindCSS
- Zustand (state management)
- React Toastify (for notifications)

### Backend:
- FastAPI
- NetworkX (for DAG validation)

## Future Improvements
- Add more customizable node types.
- Improve validation of user inputs in nodes.
- Enhance error handling for pipeline submission.
- Imrove Styling
